                         <!-- <strong>This Job </strong></p> -->
						   <div align="left">Mary Anne Desmond has been exposed to different cultures from an early age.  She lived in Japan as a small child when her father joined the Air Force and was transferred there.  Years later when the family was transferred to Rome, Italy, Mary Anne attended the American Overseas School and developed a passion for Italy’s culture, people and food.  It was that passion that prompted her to study abroad in Florence during her junior year in college and then to live in Florence for 14 years.  During her years in Florence, Mary Anne worked for an import-export company and then for a tour operator.  <br><br>
Her enthusiasm for travel eventually led her to tour Guatemala where she met her future husband, Sirio Calogero, a native of Rome.  <br><br>
In 1990 Mary Anne and Sirio moved to Phoenix, Arizona.  While Sirio taught Italian at the local colleges and universities, Mary Anne worked in the travel industry and became known for her expertise in Italy.  It was their passion for Italy that led the couple to create Il Viaggio in 1995, a tour company specializing in custom tours to Italy.  The company was sold in 2002 however Mary Anne continues to work as a consultant to the new owners and also to organize itineraries for local clients.  
In addition to her career in the travel industry, Mary Anne has been active in the local Italian organizations and has facilitated Italian language groups for the past 6 years.<br><br>
Although American by birth and ancestry, Mary Anne is certain to have Italian blood running through her veins.

                      <div align="left">A native New Yorker born in Greenwich Village and studied Italian in high school. Was fortunate to spend eight months in Italy where I developed a love of the Italian culture, and with my knowledge of Italian, I became a translator. At NYU, I majored in business and advertising, and then worked for NBC-TV for 20 years as Unit Manager, Production Manager and Associate Producer. Worked with entertainment programs as well as the New York NBC News Department where we filmed news documentaries world wide and made use of my Italian during filming many documentaries in Italy. Worked in the NBC Rome office for coverage of American Presidents' visiting Rome, and for the death, funeral and election of a new Pope. In addition, worked with many of the foreign broadcasters for worldwide news coverage. While with ABC-TV in New York and LA for 18 years, worked with the foreign broadcasters on news coverage. Was a staff member for the preparation, setup and airing of the European Broadcast Union's coverage of the 1984 International Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Presently, I am the Executive Director of the Biltmore Area Partnership, which requires me to work with many local and state officials as well as many retailers and the hospitality industry here in the greater Phoenix area. <br>
                          <br>
  Sometimes I feel I know more about parts of Italy than my own city. The culture, quality of products, life style, food and the friendliness of Italians, makes me want to introduce all Americans to Italy, and to introduce more Italians to the beauty, culture, food and life style of Arizona, which is so different to life in Italy. Perhaps, that is why, as a member of the Board of Directors for The Center for Italian Culture, I helped to start Italian conversation groups for Italians and non-Italians at Borders and Barnes and Noble every month. <br>

At 34 years old, Marino and Rosanna moved with their two young daughters to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada to pursue a real estate career.  The same year he also ventured to and fell in love with Arizona.<br><br>Marino, Rosanna and their daughters began living dividing their time each year between  the United States, Canada and Italy.

                         <!-- <strong>This Job </strong></p> -->
                      <div align="left">"Career Entrepreneur" best describes Nasco's life work.  From his first substantive venture as the founder of Cellular Communications Corporation (CCC) in 1984, Mr. Nasco's has continuously sought the application of his marketing savvy, tenacity and practical experience in the computer, electronics and wireless experience to new ventures.  
Those characteristics, coupled with enthusiasm and determination enabled him to lead CCC to become one of the top cellular retailers in the country.  CCC was also recognized as a leading developer of "fixed-cellular" application products.  
By forming a strategic alliance with GTE Mobilnet, CCC later became a GTE subsidiary in 1986.  By FY1988, CCC had grown to a thriving concern with a run rate approaching $40 million annual sales.<br><br>
From the inception of CCC, Mr. Nasco devoted resources to the creation of new products and applications of cellular technology.  His early idea of cellular call boxes along roadsides can now be seen in reality along freeways in the US and Europe.
In the early 1990s, after selling his remaining interest in CCC to GTE, he became fascinated with the prospect of using voice recognition to enhance the safety and ease of using cellular mobile telephones, and lead an effort that acquired Interstate Voice Products (IVP), a division of Figgie International.<br><br>
As a business/hobby, after IVP was acquired by VoiceTronics, Inc., Mr. Nasco pursued a long-held interest in agriculture – primarily in olive and artichoke clones specifically adapted to the Southwestern Deserts of Arizona. He has worked intensively with his long-time friend and business associate, Attillio Sonnoli, who has secured patents for six new olive cultivars, improved clones of the best Tuscany varieties, whose oil is considered to be one of the best in the world
Nasco’s experience, prior to 1984 included management positions with Tandem Computers and eight years with Burroughs Corporation (now UNISYS) in a variety of assignments that included involvement with product management and sales management and support on an international scale.<br><br>
He holds a B.B.A. degree in Business Administration from the University of Miami (Coral Gales, Florida) and an M.S. degree in Management and Information Systems from the University of Southern California (Los Angeles).
