/*
nexus - do not have enough content
Advocator - relatively close to and should integrate ok with plugins, etc
http://organizationdemo.wordpress.com/ - only for wp.com. looks like it comes from this shop:
http://organicthemes.com/ - they have various good themes and i've used the non-profit one on a different site
not great with seo (not bad either) but lots of options in the admin.
http://themes.webinane.com/iframe/lifeline-wp.html - again probably not enough content
http://themes.webinane.com/iframe/lifeline-wp.html - with a different slider this could be a winner
